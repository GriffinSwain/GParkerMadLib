This program takes multiple user inputs and gives the user three different stories to choose from. It then gives the option for the user to repeat 
the program and select if they want a new set of words or if they want to keep the original set of words they inputted.

Peer Reviewed by: Caroline Hana - I think this is the most creative and cleanest MadLib I have seen so far. It looks very very good, I like how after each question the text cleared so it wasn't confusing. I also like how you added different story lines so it doesn't get repetative. Very creative, and well done!
